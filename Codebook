Attribute Information
'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

Assign column names and merge to create one data set.

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Merge data subset with the activityType table to cinlude the descriptive activity names

4. label the data set with descriptive activity names.
Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

5. Create a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
